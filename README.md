# My Neovim setup

Remember that you need neovim 0.8 or more, which you can't get with apt, so you need to put the appimage from the neovim repo in your bin folder.

Run this to install Packer:
```bash 
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim\ ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/packer/start/packer.nvim
```
